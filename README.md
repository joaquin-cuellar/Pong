# Pong
Inspired by Dan Zaidan's C++ tutorial (which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7Ej6SUky135IAAR3PFCFyiVwanauRqj3 ).
This small Pong game acts as an opportunity to apply my C++ understanding to a tangible project and understand the basics of building a game engine from the ground up using C++.
