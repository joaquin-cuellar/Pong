# Pong C++

## About
As someone who learns best hands-on, I created this simple recreating of the timeless classic Pong as an excuse to touch up my C++ skills and create a tangible project from the ground up.

Not only was I able to become much more confident in C++, but I was able to have quite a bit of fun while I was at it!
